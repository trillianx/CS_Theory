## Chapter 1: The Role of Algorithms in Computing

We can define an **algorithm** that takes a set of N inputs and produces M output. Therefore, an algorithm is a set of computational steps that transforms the input into an output. An algorithm can also be thought of as a tool to solve a well-defined computational problem. An example would be a sorting algorithm. 

An algorithm is said to be correct when it halts with the correct output. An algorithm is said to be incorrect if it does not halt on some inputs or halts with an incorrect output. Though, incorrect algorithms can be useful if we can control their error rate. 

A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modification. 

If computers were infinitely fast and computer memory was cheap or free, would you still study algorithms? Yes, because you still need to demonstrate that the algorithm will terminate and will do so with a right answer. But computers and not infinitely fast nor is the memory free. Therefore, it is important to use algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space.
